     <p>
        Hello, Myself Rajesh Gaikwad . I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with over 3.5 years of experience building responsive,
        user-friendly web applications using React, TypeScript, JavaScript and modern web technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions and take pride in writing clean,
        maintainable code. My approach to development is user-first . I believe a good interface isn't
        just functional, but also intuitive and enjoyable to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on a range of projects including dashboards, e-commerce platforms,
        internal tools, and multi-theme systems like this one. I'm comfortable working both independently
        and in collaborative team environments, always striving to improve and learn something new every day.
